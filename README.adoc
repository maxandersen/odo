[[overview]]
== Overview

OpenShift Do (`odo`) is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. `odo` abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer, thus allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: code.

[[key-features]]
== Key features

`odo` is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as project, application, and component.
* Completely client based. No server is required within the OpenShift cluster for deployment.
* Supports multiple languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Python.
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real-time.
* Lists all available components and services from the OpenShift cluster.

[[glossary]]
== Glossary

*Application:* An application consists of multiple microservices or components that work individually to build the entire application.

*Component:* A component is similar to a microservice. Multiple
components make up an application. A component has different attributes like storage. `odo` supports multiple component types like nodejs, perl, php, python, and ruby.

*Service:* Typically a service is a database or a service that a
component links to or depends on. For example: MariaDB, Jenkins, MySQL.
This comes from the OpenShift Service Catalog and must be enabled within your cluster.
